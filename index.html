</ul>
<p>
    Welcome to a remaster of the NES version of The Legend of Zelda. It was developed using the Unity engine, Visual Studio for scripts written in C#,
    and Photoshop for sprite creation/edits. I was responsible for most of the enemy creation along with small portions of the game mechanics and level design.
    My partner did all of the creation on the custom level.

    <p>
        Welcome to Shape-Drop. Shape-Drop is a game where you are an arrow and you have to make it through holes in platforms that are coming at you. This
        is a game that I solo developed over the course of two weeks.
