</ul>
<p>
    Welcome to a remaster of the NES version of The Legend of Zelda. It was developed using the Unity engine, Visual Studio for scripts written in C#,
    and Photoshop for sprite creation/edits. I was responsible for most of the enemy creation along with small portions of the game mechanics and level design.
    My partner did all of the creation on the custom level.

    <p>
        Welcome to Shape-Drop. Shape-Drop is a game where you are an arrow and you have to make it through holes in platforms that are coming at you. This
        is a game that I solo developed over the course of two weeks.

    <li><a href="https://kapitha.itch.io/broadcast-day">Broadcast Day</a></li>
    <p>
        Broadcast Day is a single player 3D platformer where you play as a robot in an overgrown city that the local robot population calls home. 
        My main contributions to the game were the design of level 1 (the sewer level), the menus, and systems design for the gameplay mechanics. 
        This game was developed over the span of 8 weeks by a team of 5 people.
