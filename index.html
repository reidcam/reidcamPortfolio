    Welcome to a remaster of the NES version of The Legend of Zelda. It was developed using the Unity engine, Visual Studio for scripts written in C#,
    and Photoshop for sprite creation/edits. I was responsible for most of the enemy creation along with small portions of the game mechanics and level design.
    My partner did all of the creation on the custom level.
