</ul>
<p>
    Welcome to a remaster of the NES version of The Legend of Zelda. It was developed using the Unity engine, Visual Studio for scripts written in C#,
    and Photoshop for sprite creation/edits. I was responsible for most of the enemy creation along with small portions of the game mechanics and level design.
    My partner did all of the creation on the custom level.

    Controls:
        arrow keys/WASD: movement
        x: primary weapon
        z: secondary weapon
        spacebar: cycle secondary weapons
        1: god mode
        4: custom level
